# granite-lang-bytecode-probe

`granite-lang-bytecode-probe` is a Julia project for Compilers. It turns create a Julia reference implementation for bytecode workflows, centered on constraint solving, bounded scenario files, and conflict explanations into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Granite Lang Bytecode Probe

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## What It Does

- Models source form with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep intermediate state changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for bytecode output, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents evaluation checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Design Sketch

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

The only required setup is the local Julia toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Fixture Notes

`baseline` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 151. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at 39 and `surge` at 248, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Limits

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Next Directions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more compilers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
